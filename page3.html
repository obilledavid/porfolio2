                    <p class="about-text">
                        I am Cleo Janica T. Santiago, a dedicated and aspiring media professional currently in my fourth
                        year of pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Communication. Throughout my academic journey, I have
                        consistently demonstrated strong analytical, linguistic, and creative abilities, positioning
                        myself as a promising figure in the fields of broadcasting and journalism. My commitment to
                        excellence is evident not only in my academic performance but also in my active engagement in
                        communication-related activities and real-world media experiences.
                      
                        <br>
                        <br> I enhanced my practical competencies through an on-the-job training program at Lumina
                        Events, where I served as part of the production team. In this role, I contributed to various
                        aspects of event planning and execution, gaining firsthand experience in coordination,
                        production management, and behind-the-scenes communication processes. This exposure strengthened
                        my adaptability, teamwork, and sense of responsibility—qualities essential in the fast-paced
                        world of media and events.With a growing passion for storytelling and public communication, I
                        have developed notable
                        expertise in radio broadcasting and news anchoring. My clear articulation, strong command of the
                        English language, and ability to convey information with accuracy and professionalism have
                        earned recognition throughout my academic years. I have been awarded multiple distinctions for
                        Excellence in English during high school, showcasing my consistent mastery of communication. Mh
                        dedication and skill culminated in winning First Place in a News Anchoring competition, a
                        testament to my talent and potential in broadcast journalism.
                       
                        <br>
                        <br>I aspires to become a professional journalist, aiming to shed light on important issues,
                        amplify underrepresented voices, and contribute meaningfully to the field of media. I continue
                        to refine my craft, embracing opportunities that allow me to expand my experience in writing,
                        broadcasting, media production, and public communication.
                   
                        <br>
                        <br>As I approach the completion of my degree, I remain focused on building a strong
                        professional foundation, motivated by mg passion for journalism and my vision of becoming a
                        credible, responsible, and influential voice in the industry.
