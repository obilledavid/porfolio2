                    <p class="about-text">
                        I am John Alain Anzaldo, a 4th-year Bachelor of Arts in Communication student.
                        I always admire casters in every sport, especially Mobile Legends casters and basketball
                        commentators. I like how they make games exciting and fun to watch. Their energy, voice, and way
                        of telling the story of the match always inspire me to try speaking clearly and with confidence.
                        Watching them makes me want to learn more about games and how to share that excitement with
                        others.

                        <br>
                        <br> I love how shoutcasters do their job.
                        They make every match feel alive. They react quickly to what’s happening, explain important
                        plays, and keep the audience engaged. I enjoy listening to the way they use their voice, tone,
                        and emotions to make even small moments feel exciting. They make games easy to understand and
                        fun for everyone, whether someone is a new fan or an expert.

                        <br>
                        <br>I admire how they work.
                        Casters practice a lot to get their timing and delivery just right. They have to focus on every
                        moment, remember all the details, and share it in a way that tells the full story of the game. I
                        respect their patience, their passion, and how they keep improving every time they cast. They
                        show me that hard work and practice can make someone really good at what they love.

                        <br>
                        <br>I enjoy recreating what they say, and by doing this, I’ve learned how to speak like them in
                        every match or game. I practice calling big plays, describing exciting moments, and using energy
                        in my voice. I also learned how to prepare before a match, stay confident while speaking, and
                        keep the audience interested. Practicing shoutcasting has helped me improve my speaking skills,
                        timing, and ability to share exciting stories with others.
