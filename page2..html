                    <p class="about-text">
                        I am a highly adaptable creative professional who thrives under pressure and brings a unique
                        blend of artistic vision and technical skill to every project I take on. My passion for
                        communication and the arts began in Junior High School, where I first immersed myself in
                        storytelling, visual expression, and media creation. Since then, I’ve continuously expanded and
                        refined my skills across multiple creative disciplines.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br> I have a strong background in journalism, media arts, filmmaking, composing, scriptwriting,
                        video editing, and photo editing, allowing me to craft compelling narratives and transform ideas
                        into impactful visual and written content. I adapt quickly to any environment, and I approach
                        each project with creativity, precision, and a strong commitment to quality.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>My professional foundation was further strengthened through my internship at ABS-CBN
                        Corporation, where I worked as a Production Assistant. That experience gave me valuable insight
                        into production workflows, collaborative teamwork, and the fast-paced world of media, helping
                        shape the way I create and communicate today.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>Whether I’m shaping stories through film, enhancing visuals through editing, or bringing
                        artistic concepts to life, I approach every project with passion, professionalism, and a
                        dedication to delivering exceptional results. I’m constantly exploring new ideas, learning new
                        techniques, and striving to create work that resonates, inspires, and exceeds expectations.
