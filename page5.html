                    <p class="about-text">
                        Michael Edward Visleño is a 23-year-old graduating student from Padre Garcia, Batangas,
                        completing his Bachelor of Arts in Communication at Batangas State University – TNEU Lipa. His
                        academic and personal journey has been shaped by resilience, self-discovery, and a purpose
                        forged not through certainty, but through experience and quiet endurance. Though his timeline
                        has not unfolded the way he once imagined, Michael’s story reflects persistence and the courage
                        to move forward despite unanswered questions and profound personal loss.

                        <br>
                        <br> Growing up without knowing his father and losing his mother—whom he lovingly remembers as
                        his “angel”—in October 2022, Michael learned early the weight of independence and emotional
                        strength. Her passing became a defining moment that deeply affected him emotionally and
                        academically, contributing to delays in his studies. Yet he refused to allow grief to halt his
                        life’s course. Instead, he carried it with him as he continued his education—slowly, cautiously,
                        but always forward. College, for him, became more than a pursuit of a degree; it became a
                        journey of healing, rebuilding, and rediscovery.

                        <br>
                        <br>During his junior years in the Communication program, Michael often questioned his path. The
                        course felt uncertain, and he struggled to see a future he could claim as his own. But clarity
                        has a way of arriving in unexpected ways. For Michael, it came during his internship—a turning
                        point marked by the presence of a mentor who, without loud praise or direct encouragement, made
                        him feel seen. Through shared knowledge, exposure, and guidance in the world of film production,
                        this mentor recognized Michael’s potential—perhaps even before he recognized it himself.

                        <br>
                        <br>Immersing himself in the processes behind filmmaking—videography, offline video editing,
                        sound mixing, and the foundational work of a production assistant—Michael felt something shift.
                        What once felt like confusion transformed into enthusiasm. What felt directionless became
                        meaningful. As he learned the discipline, creativity, and storytelling behind production, a
                        burning fire grew within him. He began to see communication not just as an academic requirement
                        but as a platform for expression, creation, and purpose.

                        <br>
                        <br>These experiences ignited his passion for the craft. Through hands-on work in videography,
                        he learned to capture moments with intention. Through video editing, he discovered the power of
                        shaping narratives behind the scenes. Through sound mixing, he understood how emotion is carried
                        not just by what is seen, but what is heard. And through his role as a production assistant, he
                        embraced the collaborative spirit and discipline that hold a set together. Each skill became a
                        piece of his identity—proof that purpose often reveals itself through the people we meet and the
                        work that sparks something within us.

                        <br>
                        <br>Now approaching graduation, Michael Edward Visleño stands not as someone who always knew the
                        path, but as someone who chose to keep moving until the path revealed itself. His story is one
                        of delayed timelines but timely realizations—a testament to the truth that purpose is not always
                        found quickly, but deeply. Through loss, uncertainty, and the awakening of passion, Michael
                        continues to shape his identity, guided by resilience, gratitude, and a profound love for
                        storytelling and film production.
