                    <p class="about-text">
                        Jan Edan Zara is a 22-year-old communication professional with a Bachelor of Arts in
                        Communication. He has developed a versatile skill set across multiple media and communication
                        disciplines, allowing him to excel in both creative and client-facing roles. His experience
                        spans journalism, voice artistry, broadcasting, and multimedia production, underscoring his
                        ability to communicate with clarity, confidence, and impact.

                        <br>
                        <br> He previously served as a top-performing intern at Radyo Natin 105.5, where he strengthened
                        his competencies in radio broadcasting, news writing, and on-air presentation. His role in the
                        station allowed him to refine his storytelling, audience engagement, and technical production
                        skills—qualities that continue to inform his work today.

                        <br>
                        <br>Beyond broadcasting, Jan Edan has established himself as a capable Client Relations
                        Specialist, known for his professionalism, responsiveness, and ability to build and maintain
                        strong client partnerships. His background in communication provides him with the interpersonal
                        and analytical abilities needed to understand client needs and deliver tailored solutions.

                        <br>
                        <br>As a photographer and videographer, he brings a creative eye and technical proficiency to
                        visual content creation, producing compelling materials for events, campaigns, and personal
                        branding projects. Jan Edan also works as an events host, combining charisma, strong stage
                        presence, and quick thinking to ensure program flow and audience engagement.

                        <br>
                        <br>These experiences ignited his passion for the craft. Through hands-on work in videography,
                        he learned to capture moments with intention. Through video editing, he discovered the power of
                        shaping narratives behind the scenes. Through sound mixing, he understood how emotion is carried
                        not just by what is seen, but what is heard. And through his role as a production assistant, he
                        embraced the collaborative spirit and discipline that hold a set together. Each skill became a
                        piece of his identity—proof that purpose often reveals itself through the people we meet and the
                        work that sparks something within us.

                        <br>
                        <br>Overall, he is a dynamic, adaptable, and highly motivated communicator committed to
                        producing high-quality work across all platforms—whether on air, behind the camera, or in direct
                        collaboration with clients.
